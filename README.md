**A base for reading\writing process memory directly from the Windows kernel.**

**Communication is implemented on IOCTL requests.** 

**This implementation wouldn't bypass any of popular ring0 anti-cheats.**

**To use it for bypassing purposes you should reverse engineering specific programmes that prevent the use of cheats.**
